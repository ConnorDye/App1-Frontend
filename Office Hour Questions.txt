1.) <Form handleSubmit={updateList} />
    a.) So here a prop is handleSubmit? And each prop gets its own name and we access it via props."propname" because its a prop class?
    b.) what exactly does the updateList mean here? How does this spread work?
        function updateList(person) {
            setCharacters([...characters, person]);
        }

2.) What exactly is the form of const [characters, setCharacters] = useState([])?
    a.) so setCharacters is some function that allows us to modify characters? Where is it definined?
